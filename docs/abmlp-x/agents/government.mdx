          (Equation 5.14) ΔBs ≡ Bs - Bs₋₁ == ((G + rb₋₁ * Bs₋₁ + BLs₋₁)
                                              - (T + rb₋₁ * Bcb₋₁)

          "The bills 'Bs' that need to be newly issued are equal to government expenditures, 
          including its interest payments minus the govt revenues - taxes and central bank profits -
          plus the value of the newly issued long-term bonds. Needless to say, when there is a
          government surplus, or when the government deficit is financed by new issues of
          long-term bonds, the change in Treasury bills will be negative and bills will be redeemed."

          G&L p147: A Story: "Suppose that households do not want to hold so many bonds,
          either because of a change in their liquidity preference, or because they expect
          a fall in the price of bonds. Households will thus offer part of their holdings of
          bonds for sale. We can assume that the central bank purchases the offered bonds at
          the previously set price, and immediately turns around, asking the Treasury to redeem
          the bonds so obtained, exchanging them for the new issue of bills of an equivalent amount.
          
          This story is compatible with equation (5.14) which says the government issues new
          bills as a response to a government deficit and as a response to changes in the
          value of newly issued or newly retired bonds, so that we do have
          'government.bonds_issued' = 'household.bonds_demanded', while the central bank still
          only holds bills."

          Agent model issue: Household agents do not currently 'buy' or 'sell' government bonds.
          Their demands for government bonds as part of their portfolio of money assets work in the
          same way as do their demands for interest-bearing bills, that is, it is a savings account
          an agent will add part of its wealth to, or subtract part of its wealth from.
          There is currently no accounting for the relationship between a household agent
          central bank and government in the instance that a household wishes to lower its holding
          of govt bonds. A household will simply adjust for its portfolio composition change in
          'household.bonds_demanded', at the same time 'government.bonds_issued' is adjusted
          (in the opposite direction) to reflect the total amount of bonds the government now
          has outstanding to the household sector. Bond coupon payments to households
          adjust in the next step.
          
          Therefore, the final part of G&L equation 5.14, that is, '- ΔBLs₋₁ * PbL'
          (see '_value_of_new_bonds_issued'), is currently set to 0 in the model.
