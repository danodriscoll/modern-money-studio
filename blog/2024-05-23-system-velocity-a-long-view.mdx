## The Velocity and Acceleration of Supply: New Bills Issued

A simple analysis of the *velocity* and *acceleration* of a Government money system - the new bills issued - alongside real-world UK Gilt dynamics from the second quarter of 1974.

<!--truncate-->

:::info Gilt

A gilt is a UK Government liability denominated in sterling, issued by the UK Treasury and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The term "gilt" or "modern-money security" is a reference to the primary characteristic of gilts as an investment: their security.

### Velocity & Acceleration of Model Bills Issued

```python showLineNumbers title="velocity.py"
"""
Change in bills issued, from one period to the next,
as percentage of national income.
"""
import numpy as np

velocity_bills = np.diff(df["bills_issued"])
df["velocity_bills_issued"] = ((abs(velocity_bills)
                                / df["national_income"])
                                * 100)

### Analysis Charts & Notes

1. The [velocity](https://www.data-reports.net/modern-money-studio/virgo-420-23-05-2024-analysis-velocity.html) of model bills issued
2. The [acceleration](https://www.data-reports.net/modern-money-studio/virgo-420-23-05-2024-analysis-acceleration.html) of model bills issued

The *velocity* of model bills issued chart shows two periods, among others, where the *velocity* of model bills leads to a similar reaction in the real-world Gilt yield. The period between July 1997 and July 2003, however, shows the trend *velocity* of model bills issued increasing while the trend Gilt yield is decreasing. When looking at the *acceleration* of model bills issued chart, we see that across the same period there is actually a *negative acceleration* trend occurring. The *velocity* of bills issued may be increasing, but the system is experiencing *negative acceleration* - to which Gilt yields may be reacting.
