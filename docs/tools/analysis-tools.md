## Research

[Jupyter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) notebooks are used for the initial wrangling and analysis of both macro and micro model output as well as real-world economic and market data.

## LLMs & Research Possibilities

Wrangled output and domain specific texts subsequently feed a [GPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer) - a class of large language model (LLM) that can generate, classify, and summarise text in addition to having the ability to understand datasets and complete tasks in natural language.

Analyses may change, break or disappear at any time. View a summary technical [architecture](https://www.data-reports.net/studio-sketch/architecture.html).
