# Household

## Taxation and Investment Strategies

At every step a Household will decide on the amount of (wage) taxation it will pay, that is, a percentage of total tax owed on the wage received in the current step. Second, a Household will update its current wealth before deciding how much of that wealth to keep as cash money. Any remaining wealth is invested between the available portfolio of interest-bearing money assets.

## Taxation Arrangements

The model has two taxation arrangements for the return of Household agent wage and interest income. The flat and marginal rate arrangements return the income of Households in accordance with either a single fixed, or array of percentages.

### Flat & Marginal Arrangement Comparison

Using an example model test run to compare the tax to be returned under either the flat rate or marginal rate arrangement. The average wage for all Households at model step 6 was: **3625.31**

*Three example Households:*
| Household Unique ID | Wage Supplied | Flat Rate (37%) Tax Return | Marginal Rate Tax Return |
| :-------------- | :------------ | :------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| 5               | 4023.58       | 1488.72                    | 1366.38                  |
| 10              | 2438.05       | 902.08                     | 375.24                   |
| 8               | 6203.24       | 2295.20                    | 2892.14                  |

### Household Agent ID 8: Marginal Rate Tax Return Breakdown

50% of historical average wage amount at step 6: (**3625.31** / 2) = **1812.65**

1. No tax on wage amount up to the first 50% of the historical average wage amount.
2. Tax on wage amount that is between 50% and 100% of the historical average wage amount (**1812.65** * 60%) = **1087.59**
3. Tax on wage amount that exceeds 100% of the historical average wage amount ((**6203.24** - **3625.31**) * 70%) = **1804.55**

### Taxation Strategy

The effect of any taxation strategy that results in a payment percentage of less than 1 - `payment_percentage < 1` - (see household agent logic) can be similar to what Godley & Lavoie (G&L) remind us about the interest rate on page 160 of their book, Monetary Economics:

A key feature of the models (see ABMSIM and ABMPC tests) presented so far is that pure government expenditures are assumed to be exogenous. Still there is no reason to believe that pure government expenditures are impervious to what is going on in the rest of the economy. G&L describe in detail the initial negative effects of higher interest rates on the Government budget deficit; effects that are eventually reversed in the early models where Government expenditures were impervious to the apparition of larger budget deficits. ..But this may not necessarily be so. Atul Sood (1999) has shown that high real interest rates lead to higher Government deficits in the short run, as must obviously be the case, but he has also shown that these higher interest rates often lead to reduced primary deficits, that is to higher primary surpluses.

In other words, at some point, when the deficit gets too large, the Government will aim at controlling the public deficit, and to do so will reduce its pure government expenditures.

## The Portfolio Decision

The interest rate offered will affect the composition of a Household agent's asset portfolio. Model households now have a third financial asset in which to invest. Household agents will choose, based on their expectations and liquidity preferences, to allocate wealth between money, bills and long-term government bonds.

### Long-Term Bonds

View the long-term [bond framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_3DX1j2vghMV8354_DmjBqt3wyg2AwMdvVSd2qtlaC4/edit#gid=1976813024).

**Mirroring Godley & Lavoie (G&L) pp 133 - 135**

When households make their long-term bond decisions, three features matter. First, they are concerned with the price that the long-term bond fetches in the current period, for this defines the yield of the asset which will arise in the next period (model step). Second, what also matters is the expected price of the bond in the next period, when it will be possible to sell the bond. These two prices help define what we shall call the pure expected rate of return on bonds (ERrbL). The third factor is the confidence with which households hold their expectations about future bond prices. In a model where there may be a multiplicity of household agent opinions, it is a measure of the weight that households investors attribute to the validity of their expectations.

### On Agent Expectations & Information Privilege

In every step, Households think about the rate of return (ERrbL) they expect to see in the next period (step). On average, 50 percent of Households created will predict a higher ERrbL 33 percent of the time (on average), a lower ERrbL 33 percent of the time with the remaining expectation being no change in the next step. On average, 33 percent of Households will include the base rate that has been set in the previous five steps into their expectations logic. An average of 16 percent of the Household population will have access to both historical rates and logic that employs model (macro) system *velocity* and *acceleration*, that is, the rate at which the Government has been issuing new bills as a percentage of national income.

### Agents & Opinions

To assist thinking, Households communicate their rate expectation to other Households. Though it may only communicate with another of the same type (alpha, beta or gamma), a Household has no preference for which other agent it will contact. A feature of Household discussions about its rate expectation for the next period: When contacted, there is a ten percent chance the Household spoken to will inform that its rate expectation is between 1 percent and 5 percent greater than the actuality. A five percent chance it will say its rate expectation is between 1 percent and 5 percent lower than the actuality. Households will accurately state their rate expectation for the next period, on average, eighty-five percent of the time.

*Mutually exclusive possibilities a Household will match the rate expectation of another Household agent.*
| Rate Expectation (RE) in Current Step | Alpha Household | Beta Household | Gamma Household |
| :------------------------------------ | :-------------- | :------------- | :-------------- |
| Other Agent RE > Agent RE             | 10% of time     | 15% of time    | 20% of time     |
| Other Agent RE < = Agent RE           | 15% of time     | 20% of time    | 25% of time     |
| Other Agent RE < Agent RE             | 20% of time     | 25% of time    | 30% of time     |

### Gilt Options Strategy

Households will not adjust their money asset portfolios based on a change in their rate expectation. A Household will make a portfolio adjustment if, and only if, the Central bank has made a base rate adjustment in the previous step. Expectations do, however, feed into current step calculations made by all Households as part of their Gilt future options strategy (a strategy that is developed but not monetarily *accounted* for in the model).
