## From Quarterly to Monthly Time-Series Data

The [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/nmrp/) provides quarterly Government expenditure time-series. Development and analysis may benefit by exploding the quarterly expenditure series consumed by the model into a [monthly data series](https://www.data-reports.net/modern-money-studio/explode_quarterly_values.html). Monthly interest (base) rates are offered by the Central Bank (See [time-series](/docs/tools/time-series)).
