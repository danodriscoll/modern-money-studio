### Steady State System

One monetary unit of demands from either Government or Housholds will require one unit of energy to fulfil. This is a test model run (170 steps) showing simplistic Producer energy use dynamics.

#### Model Run Parameters

- Run Name: ABMLP-X Test
- Government Expenditure: 20 units per step
- Taxation rate: 20% (Flat rate; all household agents)
- Coupon Rate: 0%
- Interest Rate: 0%
